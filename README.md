# osuc
An opengl osu mania client written in c using raylib.
Warning, hobby project with really bad code (might fix bad code later, first features!)

currently working:
 - loading maps
 - playing long and short notes
 - hit sounds (partial)
 - reading name from .osu file
 - giving .osu file via argument
 - not segfaulting at non mania maps
 
not working:
 - loading non mania maps
 - backgrounds (raylib doesn't have jpg support compiled in by standard)
 - non custom hitsounds

never going to be added:
 - other game modes, mania only
 - customization
 - network / leaderboard capabilities
 - actually, just anything involving networking
